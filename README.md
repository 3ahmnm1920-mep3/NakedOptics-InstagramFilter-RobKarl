#NakedOptics-InstagramFilter-RobKarl

#ProjectDescription

    The task is to make an instagram-filter using spark AR and a 3D modell of some "Naked-Optics"-glasses. 

#Visuals


#Concept

Ice Glasses

    What should the filter be able to do?
        The filter should be interactive, so you can perform a facial expression and it does something in return.
        The glasses should freeze, as soon as you open your mouth. 
    How can I achieve this?
        I think I could make 2 models with 2 different textures for the glasses. One with a standard look and one with a damaged/frozen look to it.
        When you open your mouth, it switches between the two models and creates a feeling of the glasses instantly freezing.
    What will I need/use to achieve it?
        I will probably use blender 2.8 for the texturing part, because I'm already familiar with procedural texturing within blender and I also know how to bake those textures, so I can use it in any other 3D Software. 
        For the Filter to work, I will use  Spark AR. 


#Ideas

- Ice Glasses (animation of ice covering up the glasses)
- Fire Glasses (animation of the glasses burning)
- Shattered Glasses (Physical correct RigidBody-animation of the glasses shattering into little parts)
